o create a Python script, we can create a file ending with the file extension of .py.

Creating Our First Python Script
Let's create our first script to write our obligatory "Hello, World!" program:

$ vim hello.py
From inside this file we can enter the lines of Python that we need. For the "Hello, World!" example we only need

print("Hello, World!")
There are a few different pays that we can run this file. The first is by passing it to the python3.7 CLI.

$ python3.7 hello.py
Hello, World!
Setting a Shebang
You'll most likely want your scripts to be:

Executable from anywhere (in our $PATH)
Executable without explicitly using the python3.7 CLI
Thankfully, we can set the process to interpret our scripts by setting a shebang at the top of the file:

hello.py

#!/usr/bin/env python3.7
print("Hello, World")
We're not quite done, because now we need to make the file executable using chmod:

$ chmod u+x hello.py
Run the script now by using ./hello.py and we'll see the same result. If we'd rather not have a file extension on our script we can now remove that since we've put a shebang in the file. Renaming it to get rid of the extension (mv hello.py hello) and running ./hello will still result in Python 3.7 executing the script.

Adding Scripts to Our $PATH
Now we need to make sure that we can put this in our $PATH. For this course, we'll be using a bin directory in our $HOME folder to store our custom scripts, but scripts can go into any directory that is in your $PATH.

Let's create a bin directory and move our script:

$ mkdir ~/bin
$ mv hello.py ~/bin/hello
Here's how we add this directory to the $PATH in our .bashrc (the .bashrc for this course already contains this):

$ export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/bin
Finally, let's run the hello script from our $PATH:

$ hello
Hello, World!
