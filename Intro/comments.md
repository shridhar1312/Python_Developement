When writing scripts, we often want to leave ourselves notes or explanations. Python (along with most scripting languages) uses the # character to signify that the line should be ignored and not executed.

Single Line Comment
We can comment out a whole line:

# This is a full line comment
Or we can comment at the end of a line:

2 + 2 # This will add the numbers
What About Block Comments?
Python does not have the concept of block commenting that you may have encountered in other languages. Many people mistake a triple-quoted string as being a comment, but it is not — it's a multi-line string. That being said, multi-line strings can functionally work like comments, but they will still be allocated into memory.

This is not a block comment,
but it will still work when you really need for some lines of code to not execute.
